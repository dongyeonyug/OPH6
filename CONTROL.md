## Latest Human Nudge

Use `TripCanvas` as the initial name. Run Tighten through Compile. Deployment is required. Notion must be written in Korean and stay editable by the presenter. Use browser-local storage only. User-added images must come from local photo file selection only, with no image URL input or fallback and no real cloud upload in this iteration. Final completion requires a real visible world map with clickable countries or country regions. The desired product layout is map-first: clicking a country opens or updates a selected-country detail surface, with memories and the add-memory form in a desktop right-side panel or mobile bottom panel/sheet. Country click should show the saved photo board first, `사진 추가` should be an explicit action, and memory card click should open a large photo viewer/lightbox. Use understated visited-country map styling and reserve Pinterest Red for the selected country, primary CTA, and small active accents. Do not implement this as one long scroll page with all sections stacked. Do not show service-irrelevant Ralphthon/GOAL/PLAN/QA/GitHub/deployment/Notion evidence panels on the product surface; keep the app UI focused on the TripCanvas travel-memory service and put harness evidence in README, QA, Notion, and repo docs.
